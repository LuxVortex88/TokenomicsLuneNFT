# ðŸª™ TokenomicsLuneNFT

**TokenomicsLuneNFT** is an experimental NFT smart contract designed to simulate **DeFi mechanics** through a **Burn-to-Upgrade (BTU)** system on the Ethereum blockchain.

This project is part of a broader exploration into decentralized finance and blockchain development, aimed at understanding core Web3 concepts such as tokenomics, scarcity, and user-incentivized interaction.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- **ERC-721 NFT Minting**
  - Users can mint new NFTs by paying a small minting fee.
- **Burn-to-Upgrade (BTU)**
  - Burn an existing NFT to upgrade it to a rarer version.
- **Fee Collection**
  - Minting and upgrade transactions incur small fees, which are collected by the contract owner.
- **No External Dependencies**
  - Built entirely without OpenZeppelin, for full transparency and educational value.

## ðŸ“¦ Smart Contract Architecture

- **NFT Token Contract**
  - Written in Solidity (`TokenomicsLuneNFT.sol`)
  - Implements minting, burning, and upgrading
- **BTU System**
  - Simulates economic scarcity and user-driven token evolution
- **Fee Mechanics**
  - Ether collected during operations is stored in the contract and can be withdrawn by the owner
